Hello! Welcome to my Chess game. I enbarked on this little side project with fun and hope but I inevitably ended up getting lazy with the coding and can say that it is not the cleanest. But alast it still works properly and the only implementation missing as of yet is the rook and king swap move and draw. Other than that it is full fledged chess with all the check detection in the world. In the future I plan on expanding a AI for this/ refactoring the program / showing off my better programing skills with a new fleshed out cleaner version. If you use this program you run it in a shell of some sort and I apologize if you look into the source code. Enjoy!
